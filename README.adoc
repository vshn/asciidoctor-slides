= Reveal.js Presentation Generator

This project generates a Docker image that can be used to generate Asciidoctor+Reveal.js presentations. It isolates users from the underlying Node.js infrastructure required to create presentations.

== Build

Run the following command to build the docker image (remember to change TAG to the proper value)

`docker build -t vshn/asciidoctor-slides:TAG`

Then push the image to Docker Hub to make it publicly available.
