= Reveal.js Presentation Generator

This project generates a Docker image that can be used to generate Asciidoctor+Reveal.js presentations. It isolates users from the underlying Node.js infrastructure required to create presentations.

== Asciidoctor Slides Infrastructure

The following projects are part of the Asciidoctor Slides infrastructure:

* https://git.vshn.net/education/asciidoctor-slides[Generator] encapsulating a Node.js application driving the creation of the `slides.html` HTML file (this project)
* https://git.vshn.net/education/revealjs-template[Cookiecutter] offering a simple mechanism to generate new presentation slide projects
* https://git.vshn.net/education/slides-preview[Preview] allowing the live preview of slides on `localhost:2020`

== Build

Run the following command to build the docker image (remember to change TAG to the proper value)

`docker build -t vshn/asciidoctor-slides:TAG`

Then push the image to Docker Hub to make it publicly available.
